# bipedal-robot-learning-collection 

+ This repo is a collection for high-quality robotics papers, with specialization on **bipedal locomotion** and **reinforcement learning** with **real robot experiments**. I hope this can do a service for easy writing of literature review in papers. 

+ I separate the papers into the different categories: `Balance`, `Adaptation`, `Skillful`, `Human2Humanoid`. Welcome to contribute by nominating new papers in Issues. Last update: Jan 12 2025.    

+ For all relevant papers before CoRL 2024, there is a complete list in branch `archive/beforeCoRL2024`. Due to the explosive increase in the number of papers, I am not maintaining a full list of all the papers.
  

## Balance
This category is named after Marc Raibert's book, _Legged Robots that Balance_. The papers in this category makes the main line of bipedal locomotion: to balance on any terrain in the wild. In this line, the focus is to learn the locomotion capability, and there are three subtopics: 1) hybrid methods with model-based heuristics, 2) end-to-end learning, and 3) hardware and algorithmic engineering choices that matter. For studies on sim-to-real transfer using POMDP formulations, please refer to the `Adaptation` category.

## Adaptation
Real-world deployments often face the uncertainties in robot dynamics and sensing. Therefore, a wise way is to be adaptive to these uncertainties, which is mostly achieved by utilizing the history data. Some of the works can focus on skills, but they stand out with decent sim-to-real transfer via adaptation.

## Skillful
The community is not satisfied with only balancing. We want loco-manipulation, we want parkour. A special focus here is how to design the rewards, and the framework, on top of sim-to-real transfer.

## Human2Humanoid  
Humanoids share the human morph, so a natural idea is to using human data for humanoid control. This can involve two types of works: 1) make humanoids move like humans, and 2) help humans teleoperate humanoids and collect data.
